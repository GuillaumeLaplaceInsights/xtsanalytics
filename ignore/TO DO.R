# I think this is what I used when I implemented UPI.  Note there
# is both Ulcer Index and Ulcer Perfomance Index.

# Don

# Ulcer Performance Index which is CAGR (or sum(Rets)) / UI, annualized.
# I much prefer UPI since it is a risk adjusted gain, analogous to Sharpe, Sortino, and MAR.


# I have already modified it to pass the date range information and
# added to the return list. Since I plan to call Donâ€™s modelEC inside
# Assess_Features, I going to pass the idcols columns to Assess_Features
# so all dates and other information will be present for that and other TBD uses.
# It may be premature to do that for the package version unless you want to
# have the package version of Assess_Features return the equity curve
