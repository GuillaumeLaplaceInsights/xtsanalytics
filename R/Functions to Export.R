# Functions to Export.R
#
# A simple list to keep track of functions that are not yet exported.
# Use this to keep track of not-yet-ready functions (not yet exported),
# but that should be eventually finalized and exported.

#
#  Check hidden plotting functions.  All this code is most likely
#  unused, as it preceded xtsplot.  Going forward, I should build
#  plotting function based on interactive tools plot.ly, D3.js, etc.
#
# In file timer.R, there is a hidden function called make.indicators that is
# now deprecated.  I should delete it after making sure that make_features
# includes all the same features and more.
#
# Figure out how to document xtsanalytics-package so it's clean.  Then delete file xtsanalytics.R
#
# File xtsbootstrap contains some unexported code and functions:
#   . xtsboot
#   . DEMAab
#   . testfn
